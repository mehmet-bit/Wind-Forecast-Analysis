## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting day-ahead wind power production in Greece with high volatility management. The system provides reliable 24-hour ahead predictions and real-time actual vs. forecast comparison for operational decision support in the Greek power market.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Feature Engineering:** Lag-120 strategy with LightGBM regressor.
- **Infrastructure:** Interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time monitoring.
- **Coverage:** Approximately 6,000 MW of installed wind capacity in Greece.
- **Intellectual Property:** Proprietary model (code and model files are not publicly shared).

## 📊 Model Performance & Metrics (February 2026)

    Period: 1 – 28 February 2026

    Installed Capacity: 6,000 MW

    Total Actual Production: 1,013,477 MWh

    Total Forecasted Production: 1,121,584 MWh

    Model Accuracy: R² = 0.85

Error Metrics:

    MAE: ≈ 185 MW

    RMSE: ≈ 240 MW

The model is fine-tuned to handle the inherent stochastic nature of wind energy in Greek geography, with a strong focus on capturing ramp-up and ramp-down events to minimize balancing costs.
